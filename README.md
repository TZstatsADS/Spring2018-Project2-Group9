# Project 2: Open Data App - an RShiny app development project

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details. 

The app is available here: [Finding Coral]()

+ **Project summary**: In order to increase the recognition of the values of deep-sea corals and the awareness of the deep-sea coral protection, we create this fantastic app. It introduces various meaningful values, basic information, location, distribution as well as statistic summmaries of deep-sea corals. The app will engage and support researcheres in the study of deep-sea corals. It also help organizations who have recognized values of deep-sea corals, such as medical researchers, to identify the deep-sea corals of their interest. Moreover, it not only makes individual and business recognize values of deep-sea corals, but also engage them in deep-sea coral protection.
